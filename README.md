# ProjectManager

This was the second project I did for my Advanced Web Development class. This project made use of ASP.NET Core as well as the MVC architecture. This project was created using Visual Studio and version 1.1.* of ASP.NET Core. 

This project was made to keep track of people, the projects they are working on, and their role for that project. This project allows you to create a new person, assign them to a role, remove them from that role, delete the person, and view a report of all people based on their projects. There is also a page to change the person's role, but that functionality was not implemented. 

In this project, I learned about Object Relational Modeling and using view models to secure the information being passed around.
